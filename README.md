# Digital Visiting Card (vCard) — Template 1st

Simple static vCard template. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.

How to view
- Locally: open `index.html` in your browser.
- GitHub Pages: enable Pages in the repository settings and select the `gh-pages` branch (or `main/docs`) as the source. The site URL will typically be:

  https://Abhimanyuraj8252.github.io/Digital-Visiting-Card-vCard-/

Notes
- This repository contains static HTML/CSS/JS under the repository root.
- If you want, I can enable GitHub Pages via the API (requires a GitHub token), or configure a `docs/` folder instead of `gh-pages`.

---

If you'd like, I can also add a short license, update the title/meta tags for Pages, or create a `docs/` folder and move the site there. Tell me which you prefer.
